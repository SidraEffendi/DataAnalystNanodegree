# DataAnalystNanodegree
The repositories contains the projects I worked on during my Data Analyst Nanodegree.

**Project1:** In this project I worked with excel spreadsheet to analyse the weather data of New Delhi. I then reported a few observations of the weather trends 
in New Delhi and a comparison of it with weather treands globally.


**Project2:** Here the goal was to perform EDA(exploratory data analysis) on database with details of pateints who are either missing or keeping with their medical
appointments. Using jupyter notebook, I cleaned the data, posed questions and analysed the data to answer those questions. 


**Project3:** The project was to help a company make decision about whether they want to implement a new design of their website page, goal being it should lead to 
more people singing up for the service. I used hypothesis testing and logistic regression to draw conclusions.
